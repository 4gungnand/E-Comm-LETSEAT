## Short description
This is a NEXT js project developed by 6 team members from Gadjah Mada University.

## Purpose
The purpose of my web development project at Gadjah Mada University extends beyond showcasing skills for a university subject test. It serves as a platform to demonstrate proficiency in web development while simultaneously fostering collaborative skills in a professional context. This initiative underscores the importance of creating project reports, emphasizing a holistic approach to project management within the university setting.

## Description
The project titled "Workshop on the Implementing Software Design" was assigned to second-year computer science students at Gadjah Mada University, encompassing a comprehensive syllabus covering various aspects of software development. The syllabus included modules on implementing structured and unstructured software development tools, Scrum software development, case studies, project scope, data modeling specification implementation, UI implementation, and specifications for algorithms, procedures, processes, features, data, and transaction management. Additionally, the project involved testing modules for data, unit processes, system interaction, and integration processes, culminating in a final project presentation.

Our team conceptualized and executed, LETSEAT, a food-related e-commerce website, recognizing its potential usefulness in Indonesian society given the plethora of restaurants. Despite facing initial challenges with limited web development experience, we dedicated the first month to meticulous planning, outlining the tasks necessary to create the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Seeking guidance from the professor and collaborating with other team members, we decided to leverage the popular NEXTjs framework and utilize MongoDB as the Database.

## Special Points
For four months, our team successfully developed the e-commerce website, overcoming challenges and bugs to implement fundamental features such as item creation, updating, and deletion. Specifically, my contributions focused on building functionalities related to account registration, image uploading, and hosting, as well as deletion. This ambitious university project marked our journey from the inception of an idea to the realization of a fully functional website, showcasing our commitment and growth in the field of web development.
